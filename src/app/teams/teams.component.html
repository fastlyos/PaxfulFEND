			<span>Effective date: June 13, 2019</span>

            <p>This is an agreement between you and Paxful, Inc. (&quot;Paxful&quot;). This website and its related services are owned and operated by Paxful Inc. By signing up to use an account through paxful.com, or any associated websites, APIs, or mobile applications (collectively the &quot;Paxful Site&quot;), you agree that you have read, understood, and accept all of the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement.</p>
            <p>For all purposes, the English language version of this user agreement shall be the original, governing instrument. In the event of any conflict between the English language version of this user agreement and any subsequent translation into any other language, the English language version shall govern and control.</p>

            <h2>About Paxful</h2>
            <p>Paxful is a leading peer to peer marketplace to buy and sell digital currency with over 300 ways to exchange. Paxful also offers hosted digital wallet services. Our worldwide user base is able to post offers to either buy or sell digital currency via any means they wish. The creator of the offer is responsible for listing terms of the trade. Once an offer is selected by another Paxful user, digital currency is held in our escrow service from the party that is selling it. The digital currency is released from escrow to the buyer by the seller once the buyer has completed the terms of the trade. The escrow is released back to the seller if the buyer chooses to cancel the trade. The seller may not cancel the trade at any point. The seller only has the option to release the digital currency from escrow to the buyer. This is for the security purposes of the buyer. Should a seller need to cancel the trade due to a buyer not following the terms of the trade, they must start a dispute and provide a reason for doing so.</p>

                    software that (a) generates and stores Digital Currency Wallet Addresses and (b) Facilitates the
                    submission of Digital Currency transaction data to the relevant Digital Currency blockchain network
                    without requiring you to download or install the associated Digital Currency network software to

                            In order for transactions to be completed, the digital currency transaction must be confirmed
                    by the associated public ledger (blockchain). These blockchains are not owned or operated by Paxful
                    in any way. Transmission of these transactions is purely dependent on the specific digital currency
                    network. You understand and agree that any transaction may never complete or be significantly
                    delayed due to the network properties of the associated digital currency network.

                        <li>
                            Paxful does not store digital currency. Digital currencies are always stored on their
                    respective networks or blockchains. All digital currency transactions occur within the digital
                    currency network, not on Paxful. There are no guarantees that the transaction will process on the
                    digital currency network.

                                        Paxful acts as an escrow service between two parties. The funds are kept safe until payment
                    has been confirmed received and valid. Paxful does not act as a payment processor. All liability
                    for sending and receiving and checking the validity of the transactions lie between the buyer and
                    seller. Once payment has been confirmed, the funds will be released from escrow. In case of an issue
                    during a trade that cannot be settled, either party can dispute the trade. This will be investigated
                    by the Paxful moderators and decision will be made according to evidence provided by both the
                    parties. Paxful moderators resolve disputes by evaluating trade terms, offer instructions, evidence
                    of payment, trade chat interaction, user reputation, past trading history as well as data submitted
                    and or collected in accordance with the Privacy Notice.

                            Digital Currency Mining Defined. Mining is the process of adding transaction records to the digital 
        currency’s public ledger of past transactions (and a “mining rig” is a colloquial metaphor for a single computer 
        system that performs the necessary computations for “mining”). This ledger of past transactions is called the 
        blockchain as it is a chain of blocks. The blockchain serves to confirm transactions to the rest of the network 
        as having taken place. Digital currency nodes use the blockchain to distinguish legitimate digital currency 
        transactions from attempts to re-spend coins that have already been spent elsewhere. Mining is intentionally 
        designed to be resource-intensive and difficult so that the number of blocks found each day miners remains 
        steady. Individual blocks must contain a proof of work to be considered valid. This proof of work is verified by 
        other digital currency nodes each time they receive a block. The primary purpose of mining is to allow digital 
        currency nodes to reach a secure, tamper-resistant consensus. Mining is also the mechanism used to introduce 
        digital currency into the system: Miners are paid any transaction fees as well as a “subsidy” of newly created 
        coins. This both serves the purpose of disseminating new coins in a decentralized manner as well as motivating 
        people to provide security for the system.
